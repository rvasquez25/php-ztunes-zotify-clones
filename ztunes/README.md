# Apple iTunes webpage Clone #

This is a clone of the apple.com's iTunes webpage created using HTML, CSS and my custom CSS Framework.

I did this project as part of the The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)

UI (not php logic for handling data) from the following github repo: https://github.com/ARaut9/itunes_clone
